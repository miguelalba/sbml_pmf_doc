\section{Background and context}
\label{Background}

The encoding of Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) models requires
special meta data that is not present in SBML. The Predictive Microbial
Modelling in Food Markup Language (PMF-ML) addressed this challenge, extending
SBML to describe more precisely QMRA models.

The strategy followed by PMF-ML was to further annotate SBML constructs such as
Model and Rule with extra information carefully encoded within the annotation of
this element.

While this strategy was relatively simple to implement its shortcomings
eventually appeared, like difficult validation, hard maintenance or inability to
supporting different implementations for different versions of SBML. This
extension package aspires to address these issues.
