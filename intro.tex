\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

The encoding of predictive microbial models may require a significant amount of
model meta data. SBML proves to be a major step in the right direction though it
does not describe completely some models.

The SBML Level~3 PMF package addresses these shortcomings, extending SBML with
extra classes and attributes in order to achieve a more meaningful and accurate
description of the models.

\subsection{Proposal corresponding to this package specification}

% TODO: Check in Groups proposal
This specification for PMF in SBML Level~3 Version~1 is based on the proposal
located at the following URL:

% TODO: Check in Groups proposal
The tracking number in the SBML issue tracking system~\citep{tracker} for Groups package activities is 2847474.  The version of the proposal used as the starting point for this specification is the version of June, 2012~\citep{hucka_2012}.

\subsection{Package dependencies}

The PMF package has no dependencies on other SBML Level~3 packages.


\subsection{Document conventions}
\label{conventions}

UML~1.0 (Unified Modeling Language; \citealt{eriksson:1998, oestereich:1999}) notation is used in this document to define the constructs provided by this package.  Colors in the diagrams carry the following additional information for the benefit of those viewing the document on media that can display color:

\begin{itemize}

\item[\raisebox{2.75pt}{\colorbox{black}{\rule{0.8pt}{0.8pt}}}]
  \emph{Black}: Items colored black in the UML diagrams are components
  taken unchanged from their definition in the SBML Level~3 Core
  specification document.

\item[\raisebox{2.75pt}{\colorbox{mediumgreen}{\rule{0.8pt}{0.8pt}}}]
  \emph{\textcolor{mediumgreen}{Green}}: Items colored green are
  components that exist in SBML Level~3 Core, but are extended by this
  package.  Class boxes are also drawn with dashed lines to further
  distinguish them.

\item[\raisebox{2.75pt}{\colorbox{darkblue}{\rule{0.8pt}{0.8pt}}}]
  \emph{\textcolor{darkblue}{Blue}}: Items colored blue are new
  components introduced in this package specification.  They have no
  equivalent in the SBML Level~3 Core specification.

\end{itemize}

The following typographical conventions distinguish the names of objects and data types from other entities; these conventions are identical to the conventions used in the SBML Level~3 Core specification document:

\begin{description}
  
\item \abstractclass{AbstractClass}: Abstract classes are never instantiated directly, but rather serve as parents of other classes.  Their names begin with a capital letter and they are printed in a slanted, bold, sans-serif typeface.  In electronic document formats, the class names defined within this document are also hyperlinked to their definitions; clicking on these items will, given appropriate software, switch the view to the section in this document containing the definition of that class.  (However, for classes that are unchanged from their definitions in SBML Level~3 Core, the class names are not hyperlinked because they are not defined within this document.)
  
\item \class{Class}: Names of ordinary (concrete) classes begin with a capital letter and are printed in an upright, bold, sans-serif typeface.  In electronic document formats, the class names are also hyperlinked to their definitions in this specification document.  (However, as in the previous case, class names are not hyperlinked if they are for classes that are unchanged from their definitions in the SBML Level~3 Core specification.)

\item \token{SomeThing}, \token{otherThing}: Attributes of classes, data type names, literal XML, and tokens \emph{other} than SBML class names, are printed in an upright typewriter typeface.

\end{description}

For other matters involving the use of UML and XML, this document follows the conventions used in the SBML Level~3 Core specification document.
